The vectorizations are trained in terms of relationships to other words, and so what the representations actually mean is ambiguous.  The computer can understand this vector language, and that’s the most important part to us.

    "Recurrent Neural Networks (also known as RNNs) are a sequence-learning tool for neural networks. This type of neural network has only one layer’s worth of hidden inputs, which is re-used for each input from the sequence, along with a “memory” that’s passed ahead to the next input’s calculations. These are calculated using matrix multiplication where the matrix indices are trained weights, just like they are in a fully-connected layer. \n",
